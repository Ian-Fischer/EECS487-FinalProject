Political Media Bias Prediction for Resource-Limited Devices

This research investigates the need for bias detection in news media, specifically for low-
powered devices such as phones and tablets. The study utilizes natural language processing
techniques to predict the political bias present in news articles at the sentence level. Previous
studies using the BERT transformer, bag-of-words, and SimCSE learning framework have shown
promising results in determining sentence-level bias. This paper discusses recent studies using the
RoBERTa language model, the LSTM neural network, and the Multilayer Perceptron models
(MLP). The BASIL dataset, consisting of 300 annotated articles from three political news
sources, was used for sentence-level bias prediction. To process the data, the bias score for each
annotation was calculated using the political leaning of the main entity and the polarity of the
text. The paper concludes that natural language processing techniques have the potential to
detect political bias in news media and provide users with knowledge of the biases present in
their media.
